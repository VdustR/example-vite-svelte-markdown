## Good stuff in your markdown

Markdown is pretty good but sometimes you just need more.

Sometimes you need a boinger like this:

<Boinger color="{ color }"/>

Not many people have a boinger right in their markdown.

## Markdown in your markdown

Sometimes what you wrote last week is so good that you just _have_ to include it again.

I'm not gonna stand in the way of your egomania.

> <Section />
> <Count />

Yeah, thats right you can put widgets in markdown (`.svx` files or otherwise). You can put markdown in widgets too.

### I wasn't joking

```
  This is real life

</Seriously>

Sometimes you need your widgets **inlined** (like this:<Count count="{number}"/>) because why shouldn't you.
Obviously you have access to values defined in YAML (namespaced under `metadata`) and anything defined in an fenced `js exec` block can be referenced directly.

Normal markdown stuff works too:

| like  | this |
| ----- | ---- |
| table | here |

And _this_ and **THIS**. And other stuff. You can also use all your favorite Svelte features, like `each` blocks:

<ul>
{#each list as item}
  <li>{item}</li>
{/each}
</ul>

and all the other good Svelte stuff.
